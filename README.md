# The-Impossible-Trading-Bot-
On dark rainy night filled with monster and pizza I was scrolling through trading forums on Reddit. Everyone seems to have the same issues; repainting too strict, too soft etc etc. 
So I can up with the idea of combining all reasonable trading confluences into one strategy/indicator.
However, of course i can't just give it to you for free 😂 
So here is the trick ive included the script but the filters are extremely strict and not the in the right order.
If you can figure it out the win rate 82.3% with a profit factor of more than 2
If you can figure it out ill give you £100
GoodLuck🫡
